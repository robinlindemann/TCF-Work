                            message, text message, email, push notification or other form of communication. You agree that we may use an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice to contact 
                            you at the telephone number(s) you have provided to us. <br/>
                        Your agreement in this section also extends to third parties that may initiate calls or send messages on our behalf, including our vendors, third-party service providers, companies with which we
                            may have joint marketing agreements, and any party to whom we sell your Wholesale Product or Service.

                        <h1>Hardware and Software Requirements</h1>
                        <p>In order to access the Digital Services and retain Communications provided or made available to you in electronic form, your computer and mobile device (if applicable) must be compatible with 
                            the current hardware and software requirements we and any Technology Provider establish for use of the Digital Services. These requirements include: (i) the ability to operate the most recent 
                            or prior version of Windows, mac OS X, iOS, or Android; (ii) an operating system that supports the most recent or prior version of Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Google Chrome. For
                            some uses of the Digital Services, you will need Adobe Acrobat Reader version 11.0 or higher and JavaScript. In addition, your computer will need to include a router, modem, or browser that 
                            supports Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) Protocol and Internet access with 2048 bit encryption; or you will need a mobile device with Internet access that supports automated (SMS) text message 
                            service capabilities and/or supports either: (1) mobile browser with SSL Protocol; or (2) Apps for iOS available from the iTunes Store and/or Apps for Android available from the Google Play 
                            Store. You are responsible for the setup and maintenance of your own equipment to satisfy these hardware and software requirements and all related expenses. <br/>

                            Terms. For maximum security and optimal function, always use the latest version of software. Beta versions of browsers and operating systems are not recommended or supported.
                        If a change in hardware or software requirements is needed for you to access the Digital Services, we will notify you of the revised requirements.</p>
                        
                        <h1>Alerts and Reminders</h1>
                        <p>If any of your Digital Services include the option for Alerts and Reminders, you must enroll for them within the applicable Digital Services application or through your Banking Contract, as
                            applicable. By enrolling for Alerts and Reminders, you agree to receive Alerts and Reminders through email, text messages, push notification, and/or display through the Digital Services 
                            application. If you want to stop receiving Alerts and Reminders, you agree to unenroll through the applicable Digital Services application or per the terms of your Banking Contract, as 
                            applicable.
                        Although Alerts and Reminders are designed to give you notice of specific events, we do not guarantee immediate notice. Errors, interruptions, delays or failures in our delivery, or your receipt of
                            Alerts and Reminders can happen for a variety of reasons. These reasons may include technical difficulties experienced by us, your Internet service provider, wireless service provider, or others.
                            If you choose to have your Alerts and Reminders delivered to a mobile device, keep in mind that a portion of the Alerts and Reminders or related information and disclaimers may be omitted.
                        If you use or rely on the Alerts and Reminders, you do so at your own risk. We do not guarantee that the Alerts and Reminders will be: (1) timely; (2) accurate; (3) reliable; or (4) complete. We also do 
                            not guarantee that information contained in the Alerts and Reminders will not be intercepted by an unauthorized person.</p>
                        
                        <h1>Mobile Application</h1>
                        <p>Some of our Digital Services may not be available through mobile applications. When Digital Services are available through our mobile applications, we may use abbreviations of defined terms for Communications
                            we send by automated (SMS) text message, push notifications, and/or display on the mobile applications due to space limitations. The number of transactions that we can display using our mobile applications
                            for Digital Services mobile application may be limited. <br/>
                        One or more of the mobile applications for Digital Services may allow you to log in using the biometric authentication technology if your mobile device has this technology enabled. Biometric authentication may
                            include, but is not limited to, fingerprint, facial recognition, or voice. If one of our mobile applications has this option, you may enable or disable the available biometric login features at any time within
                            the mobile settings of the application. If you enable the biometric login feature on the application, anyone with a biometric setup on your device will be able to log in to the application and access your
                            Digital Services. Do not use the biometric login features if you share your mobile device with others.</p>

                        <p>The Digital Services generally are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. However, the Digital Services may not be available at certain times because of: (1) system maintenance and downtime; (2) 
                            circumstances beyond our control; or (3) other reasons. Digital Services may not be available in all countries outside the United States. Although certain Digital Services and certain Communications, such as the 
                            Alerts and Reminders, are designed to give you timely notice of specific events, we do not guarantee immediate notice. Errors, interruptions, delays or failures in the Digital Services and/or our delivery or your
                            receipt of Communications happen for a variety of reasons. These reasons may include technical difficulties experienced by us, your internet service provider, your wireless service provider, or others. <br/>
                        We may temporarily or permanently change, suspend, or terminate your access to the Digital Services at any time and for any reason without notifying you beforehand. Immediately upon such termination, you shall have
                            no further right, title or interest in or to the Digital Services or any part thereof. The Digital Services are available through your computer or mobile device only when it is connected to the Internet. <br/>
                        You may unenroll in the Digital Services at any time by contacting us. These Terms will survive (continue in full force and effect) if you unenroll from or we terminate any of the Digital Services.</p>

                            security procedures; (2) we have reason to believe may not be authorized by the Customer; (3) involves funds or other property subject to a hold, dispute, restriction or legal process; (4) we believe would
                            violate any guidelines or advice of the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or other regulatory agency with jurisdiction over us; (5) we believe would violate any applicable 
                            laws; (6) does not comply with any requirement of our policies, procedures, or practices; or (7) we have other reasonable cause not to honor. </p>

                            behalf of such Customer and to notify us within 48 hours of a change in if any individual's responsibilities or departure from the Customer that warrants removal of such individual as a user of the Digital Services.</p>

                        This limitation of liability applies, whether you base an action against TCF or the TCF-Related Parties on: (a) the contract; (b) a warranty; (c) a tort (such as claim of negligence, recklessness, 
                        or intentional act); or (d) any other theory. This limitation of liability applies even if TCF or any of the TCF-Related Parties know about the possibility of such damages. Therefore, by way of example,
                        TCF and the TCF-Related Parties will not be liable to you for lost data, lost profits or goodwill, investment losses, finance charges, lost opportunities, cost of obtaining substitute services, or other
                        economic damages. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms and without limiting the scope of the foregoing limitation of liability provision, the aggregate damages that may be recovered by
                        you in connection with the Digital Services and/or these Terms may not exceed $500. You acknowledge that we have relied upon the limitation of liability set forth in these Terms and, but for the inclusion
                            of this limitation of liability, we would not provide the Digital Services.<br/>
                        The laws of some states may prohibit the limitation of liability for consequential damages, or incidental damages, or other kinds of damages. In those states, to the extent their laws apply, the limitation
                        of liability with respect to consequential damages, or incidental damages (or other damages specified by law in such states), may not apply. In no event will we be liable for any failure of availability or
                            performance due to scheduled system maintenance or circumstances beyond our control. This includes power outages, computer viruses, system failures, fire, flood, earthquakes, or extreme weather.<br/>
                        The information provided to you pursuant to the Digital Services does not constitute advice, an offer to buy or sell, or a solicitation of business. Before acting on any information, you should consider
                        your or your company's needs, objectives and financial considerations. Banking products or services mentioned or featured within the Digital Services may or may not be suitable for you or your company and
                            may not be available to all customers in all geographic areas, and your or your company's eligibility for particular products or services is subject to approval or acceptance by us.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Indemnification</h2>
                        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold TCF and the TCF-Related Parties harmless from any and all actions, suits, claims, damages, losses, liabilities, penalties, assessments, charges, taxes, 
                            costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs of investigation and court costs at the trial level and in any appeal) (together, the "Losses") directly or indirectly arising from 
                            or relating to: (1) your use of the Digital Services; (2) any fraud, misrepresentation, or breach by you of these Terms; or (3) your failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations;
                            provided, however, that you shall not be obligated to indemnify TCF or any TCF-Related Parties for any Losses to the extent that such Losses are caused solely by the gross negligence or willful
                            misconduct of TCF or the TCF-Related Party (as applicable).</p>
                        
                        <h2>No Waiver</h2>
                        <p>This Agreement gives us certain rights. If we do not take advantage of all of our rights all the time, we do not give up (waive) any of those rights. No waiver of our rights under these Terms is 
                            enforceable against us unless it is in writing and signed by us.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Entire Agreement; Severability</h2>
                        <p>This Agreement and the terms of your Banking Contracts comprise the entire agreement between you, TCF and the TCF-Related Parties concerning the Digital Services and online and mobile access to 
                            your Wholesale Products and Services, and they replace all previous and contemporaneous agreements between you and us concerning the Digital Services and online and mobile access to your Wholesale
                            Products and Services. If there is any conflict between these Terms and applicable federal or state law or regulation, these Terms will be considered changed to the extent necessary to comply with 
                            the law. If any provision in these Terms is declared to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal by any adjudicatory body of competent jurisdiction or any governmental regulatory agency, such provision
                            shall be construed as being severed from these Terms and shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions. Any provision of these Terms found invalid or unenforceable only 
                            in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not found invalid or unenforceable.</p>
                        <h2>Captions and Headings</h2>
                        <p>Captions, headings and subheadings used in these Terms are only for reference purposes and are not intended to limit the meaning or scope of these Terms.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
                        <p>TCF is a national bank with its main office in South Dakota. Therefore, all disputes relating in any way to these Terms will be governed by federal law. Federal law includes the National Bank Act

                            These Terms and your access to and use of the Digital Services are governed by and will be construed in accordance with applicable federal law and the law of the State of Minnesota, without regard to
                            the principles of conflicts of laws. All actions, claims or disputes arising under or relating to these Terms or the Digital Services shall be brought in the federal or state courts in the State of
                            Minnesota. You and we irrevocably submit and consent to the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over each party by the federal and/or state courts in the State of Minnesota.
                            You and we hereby irrevocably waive any and all objections which any party may now or hereafter have to the exercise of personal and subject matter jurisdiction by the federal or state courts in the
                            State of Minnesota and to the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such federal or state court in the State of Minnesota. You and we hereby waive any right to a trial by jury in any
                            action or proceeding, regardless of the theory of law on which it is based, arising from or related to these Terms or the Digital Services.</p>
